# Cres: C dependency resolution

## Intro

The primary goal of this project is to ease the compilation of object files from a set of C source files, based on their header inclusion statements, and subsequently link these objects to produce an executable. Additional functionalities may include generating header declarations for specific C files, integrating commands into a build pipeline (similar to cmake but with basic features), and maybe more.

## TLDR

Automate the generation of compilation commands for modular C projects starting from an entry file.
